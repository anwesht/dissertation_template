# Dissertation Template

I quickly created a template for the dissertation format requirement at USF.

Tested and working on Overleaf. Miktex should work too. Becareful when including ackages.


If the format requirement changes and you want to submit a pull request (PR) please send a PR per change (like that I can review and accept quickly). KISS, Keep It Stupid Simple.

Good luck :)
